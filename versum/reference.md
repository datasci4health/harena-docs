# Versum Reference

[Versum](/versum/README.md) is a narrative scripting language derived from Markdown, having narrative structures inspired in Ink. Besides the [Standard Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), Versum adopts the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

This document is a reference guide for Versum writers. Part of the language is still under debate; in this case, it will have an `[under debate]` indication.
